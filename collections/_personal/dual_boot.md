title:  "Dual-boot Setup: Windows and Ubuntu with Shared Drive"
date:   May 2024
description: "Implemented a dual-boot configuration on a Windows 11 laptop to enhance flexibility for development and general computing needs. Key activities included configuring the system to run both Windows 11 and Ubuntu, ensuring seamless switching between operating systems; allocating and formatting disk partitions to support Ubuntu installation without compromising the existing Windows environment; setting up a shared NTFS drive accessible by both operating systems for efficient file sharing and collaboration; and optimizing Ubuntu for development, including software installation and performance tuning. This project expanded technical proficiency in system configuration, OS installation, disk management, and cross-platform compatibility."

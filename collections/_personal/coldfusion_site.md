title:  "Website Development with Legacy ColdFusion Code"
date:   April 2023
description: Developed and enhanced a web application using legacy ColdFusion code to meet modern requirements. Key responsibilities included analyzing and understanding existing ColdFusion codebase to identify reusable components and areas for optimization; designing and implementing new features while maintaining compatibility with the legacy system architecture, debugging and refactoring legacy ColdFusion code to improve performance, scalability, and maintainability; and integrating modern front-end technologies (e.g., MySQL, HTML, CSS) for an improved user experience. This project enhanced my ability to work with legacy technologies, MVC, RESTful API's, ensure system sustainability, and deliver modern solutions within established frameworks.

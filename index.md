<p>
  Welcome! I am a software and cybersecurity enthusiast. I grew up in Boise, ID where I am currently attending Boise State University pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with an emphasis in cybersecurity. I graduate in May and am presently searching for positions in IT and Cybersecurity. I am currently working as a security analyst in an internship program for the Institute for Pervasive Cybersecurity (IPC). 

  When I'm not working, I love hiking, snowboarding, fishing, playing guitar, and traveling!

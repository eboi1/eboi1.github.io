Welcome! I’m a software and cybersecurity enthusiast from Boise, Idaho. I graduated Magna Cum Laude from Boise State University with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and an NSA-certified Cybersecurity emphasis. I recently earned my CompTIA Security+ certification and am currently working on software and networking projects while pursuing my Network+ certification. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, fishing, snowboarding, dirt biking, playing guitar, and traveling.

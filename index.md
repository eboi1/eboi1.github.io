  Welcome! I am a software and cybersecurity enthusiast. I grew up in Boise, ID where I am currently attending Boise State University pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with an emphasis in cybersecurity. I graduate in May and am presently searching for positions in IT and Cybersecurity. I currently work as a network operations technician at Corporate IT Solutions. When I'm not working, I love hiking, fishing, snowboarding, dirt biking, playing guitar, and traveling!
